# Platform Recommender Application
This is a university project that recommends the most suitable digital health data collection and analysis platform based on a user's available resources and needs.

# Components
- Market Analysis.pdf: A detailed report analyzing six different digital health data collection and analysis platforms.
- platform-recommender.py: The Python script that interacts with the user to suggest the most suitable platform based on their responses.
- diagram.md: A Mermaid diagram that visually represents the decision tree used by the recommender application.

# How It Works
## Market Research Document:
The Market Analysis.pdf provides a comprehensive evaluation of six digital health platforms, helping you understand the features, pros, and cons of each. Review this document to familiarize yourself with the platforms before using the recommender.

## Platform Recommender Application:
Run the platform-recommender.py script. The application will ask you a series of yes/no questions about your resources and requirements. Based on your answers, the application will suggest the most suitable platform for your needs.

## Decision Tree Visualization:
To understand how the recommendation was made, open and run the diagram.md file. This file contains a Mermaid diagram that visually depicts the decision tree used in the recommender application.

# To view the diagram:
You can use an online Mermaid live editor, such as Mermaid Live Editor, to paste the contents of diagram.md and render the diagram.
Alternatively, you can install a Mermaid plugin in your local environment (e.g., in Visual Studio Code) to view the diagram directly.

# To run the application
Simply download and run the code on your choice of environment.
